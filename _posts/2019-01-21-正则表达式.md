## A compiled representation of a regular expression

| Construct	    | Matches |
| -----------:  | :-----  |
| _Characters_  |
| `x`           | The character x 
| `\\`          | The backslash character
| `\0n`	        | The character with octal value 0n (0 <= n <= 7)
| `\0nn`        | The character with octal value 0nn (0 <= n <= 7) 
| `\0mnn`       | The character with octal value 0mnn (0 <= m <= 3, 0 <= n <= 7)
| `\xhh\`       | The character with hexadecimal value 0xhh
| `\uhhhh`      | The character with hexadecimal value 0xhhhh
| `\x{h...h}`   | The character with hexadecimal value 0xh...h (Character.MIN_CODE_POINT  <= 0xh...h <=  Character.MAX_CODE_POINT)
| `\t`	        | The tab character ('\u0009')
| `\n`	        | The newline (line feed) character ('\u000A')

| `\e`	        | The escape character ('\u001B')
| `\cx`	        | The control character corresponding to x
| _Character classes_ |
| `[abc]`	    | a, b, or c (simple class)
| `[^abc]`	    | Any character except a, b, or c (negation)
| `[a-zA-Z]`	| a through z or A through Z, inclusive (range)
| `[a-d[m-p]]`	| a through d, or m through p: [a-dm-p] (union)
| `[a-z&&[def]]`	| d, e, or f (intersection)
| `[a-z&&[^bc]]`	| a through z, except for b and c: [ad-z] (subtraction)
| `[a-z&&[^m-p]]`	| a through z, and not m through p: [a-lq-z] (subtraction)
| _Predefined character classes_ |
| `.`	        | Any character (may or may not match line terminators)
| `\d`	        | A digit: [0-9]
| `\D`	        | A non-digit: [^0-9]
| `\h`	        | A horizontal whitespace character: [ \t\xA0\u1680\u180e\u2000-\u200a\u202f\u205f\u3000]
| `\H`      	| A non-horizontal whitespace character: [^\h]
| `\s`	        | A whitespace character: [ \t\n\x0B\f\r]
| `\S`	        | A non-whitespace character: [^\s]
| `\v`	        | A vertical whitespace character: [\n\x0B\f\r\x85\u2028\u2029]
| `\V`	        | A non-vertical whitespace character: [^\v]
| `\w`	        | A word character: [a-zA-Z_0-9]
| `\W`	        | A non-word character: [^\w]
| _Boundary matchers_ |
| `^`       	| The beginning of a line
| `$`	        | The end of a line
| `\b`	        | A word boundary
| `\B`	        | A non-word boundary
| `\A`	        | The beginning of the input
| `\G`	        | The end of the previous match
| `\Z`	        | The end of the input but for the final terminator, if any
